# Django_Blog
A blog created using Django, HTML and Bootstrap 4. Users are able to log in, log out, and recover their accounts if they forget their password. They are also able to create and delete posts, and see other users' posts. They can also upload custom avatars to customize their profile (avatars get stored in Amazon servers) . The website is also designed to show only 5 posts per page to make it look less cluttered and load faster. Changing the username, email, and avatar of a user can be done inside the account of each user.
